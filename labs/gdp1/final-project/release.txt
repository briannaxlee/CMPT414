Known issues:
So far in the game, the only issues that I have come into so far have to be with the animation of the enemies. There was something about the original design
of the sprites the didn't really work with animating it where it made sense. Any other image that I came across for the aliens didn't fit the aesthetic of
the background or 8-bit design. The one issue I continued to have was when the player is done with the game, there should be a way for the player to indicate
if they wanted to play another round. In order to do so, I oringally wanted to make sure that the player is routed back to the menu so they can play again,
but my thought process for doing so was to have a delay after the text display of the player's game status so that it would automatically go back to the menu.
However, when I implemented the pygame.time.delay, the explosion would freeze on the screeen and it would never print "Game Over" or "You Win" so I decided to
drop it until I could figure out a way for the explosion not to freeze. However, I never came across the solution, so it has not been implemented into the game.
